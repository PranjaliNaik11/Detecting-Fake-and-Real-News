# Detecting Fake/Real News using TfidfVectorizer and PassiveAggressive Classifier

## Overview
This project aims to detect fake news articles using machine learning techniques. We leverage the TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into numerical features and train a PassiveAggressive Classifier to distinguish between real and fake news.

## Dataset
We use a dataset containing labeled news articles, where each article is labeled as either real or fake.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas

## Model Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- Accuracy: 93.37%

## Confusion Matrix
array([[586,  42],
       [ 42, 597]])

## Conclusion
Our model demonstrates promising results in detecting fake news articles. Further improvements and optimizations can be made to enhance its performance.
